          <h1>Darko (US)</h1>
          <p>Darko US or Darko is an American deathcore supergroup formed in 2020. The band was formed by Tom Barber of Chelsea Grin (ex-Lorna Shore) and Josh "Baby J" Miller of Spite (ex-Emmure) who also later joined Chelsea Grin.</p>
          <h3>Musical Style</h3>
          <p>Darko has been described primarily as deathcore, as well as metalcore, djent, and nu metal. In an interview discussing the release of Dethmask, Pt. 2, Miller stated that he has metal influences however listens to the genre sparingly. One specific influence was his former Emmure bandmate, Joshua Travis, who Miller said was like a mentor.</p>
          <p>Despite deathcore being a genre associated with a heavier sound, growled vocals, and breakdowns, Miller noted taking inspiration from other genres that heavily feature synths and singing when writing Darko songs.</p>
          <h3>Lyrical Themes</h3>
          <p>Darko's lyrical subjects have touched on existentialism, herd behavior, dealing with loss, and social reform. Many of their songs contain themes and references drawn from various mediums of fantasy and science fiction. They have featured mentions to video games such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Dark Souls, and The Last of Us, manga series such as Gantz, as well as the media franchise Mars Attacks. Darko have also written about subjects with personal significance, such as their single Donna, a song about Miller's late grandmother, Donna Miller</p>
